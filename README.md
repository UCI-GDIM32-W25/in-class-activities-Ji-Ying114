## Activity 1
- Try to figure out the problems you encounter by yourself first before turning to LA's or generative Ai.
- Read pre-learning slides carefully
- Do not do your homework at the very last day
## Activity 2
1. 10
2. 2
3. The first method calls the second method and the second method prints "hello world" in the log.
4. MonoBehaviour
5. Debug.Log("x = 10");
6. 1. Argument: passing a value to the parameter
    2. Parameter: sth to the output
7. It should be the _playerTransform (the instance) used instead of Transform (the static method)

1. The finite state machine can posess the pigeons with different status based on the distance between the transform of pigeon and that of the player. The finite state machine contains 3 statuses. 
2. There are two different types of pigeons, having different sprites and reactions when the finite state machine indicates the status of close. There can be a parent class of pigeon and two respective child classes, so that the child classes can inherit some of the methods so that I dont have to write them repatatively, and I can make the code structure more organized.
